Cosine Similarity
In subject area: Computer Science

Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors in an inner product space. 
It determines the degree to which two vectors are pointing in the same direction by calculating 
the cosine of the angle between them. Cosine similarity is commonly used in text analysis to measure 
the similarity between documents based on the frequency of words or phrases they contain.
