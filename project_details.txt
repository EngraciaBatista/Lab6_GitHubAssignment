Cosine Similarity
In subject area: Computer Science

Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors in an inner product space. 
It determines the degree to which two vectors are pointing in the same direction by calculating 
the cosine of the angle between them. Cosine similarity is commonly used in text analysis to measure 
the similarity between documents based on the frequency of words or phrases they contain.

Cosine Simlarity Code Example:

import math

def cosine_similarity(vec1, vec2):
    # Ensure both vectors are the same length
    if len(vec1) != len(vec2):
        raise ValueError("Vectors must be the same length")

    # Calculate dot product
    dot_product = sum(a * b for a, b in zip(vec1, vec2))
    
    # Calculate magnitudes
    magnitude1 = math.sqrt(sum(a*2 for a in vec1))
    magnitude2 = math.sqrt(sum(b*2 for b in vec2))

    # Compute cosine similarity
    return dot_product / (magnitude1 * magnitude2)

# Example usage:
vec_a = [1, 2, 3]
vec_b = [4, 5, 6]

similarity = cosine_similarity(vec_a, vec_b)
print("Cosine Similarity:", similarity)
